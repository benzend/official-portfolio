Why would you want to start creating your first blog site using Next.js?
It's a good question indeed, especially since there are fantastic frameworks out there
like [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), which has been a popular framework to build out static sites over the last
couple of years.

Next.js has gained lots of traction recently, being a hot topic of the development world
especially when it comes to talking about [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Now getting back to the question _why use Next.js for your first blog site_ we need to think of
a couple things:

- Are you a programmer just starting out?
- Are you persistent in extreme scalability and ultimate freedom?
- Do you like [pineapple on pizza](https://www.goodfood.com.au/eat-out/news/why-do-so-many-people-find-pineapple-on-pizza-offensive-20190424-h1dqrc)?

If you answer yes to any of these questions, then Next.js is definitely for you!

On a serious note however, Next.js is a generous and flexible framework to jump onto.

It supports [SSR and SSG](https://betterprogramming.pub/server-side-rendering-vs-static-site-generation-53a34872728c),
comes with [api handling](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) and can do pretty much whatever you need
it to. It's one of those frameworks where there's tons of freelancing work just begging for Next.js developers.

With all that in mind, we should get started!

## Initializing Your Project

If you've never used Next.js before but have familiarity with React (highly recommended), this
tutorial is perfect for you! However even with little to no React or Next.js experience, you
should be fine in following along. It will still provide an easy to digest thesis around the language
that you will be digesting something valuable out of it.
