There's multitudes of fear hovering the space surrounding AI and what it means for the future of people: loss of jobs, meaning and the value of creativity. Nobody really knows how far off we are from it being able to replicate everything we're currently able to produce. The closer we get to full fledged AI, the more real this issue becomes.

On the flip side of the coin, we have automation removing tasks that produce less value, allowing us to focus on some of the more important items that we have in our day to day lives - allowing us to live more prosperously if done correctly and removing all instances of larger world issues like poverty and hunger.

I want us to dive into the less extreme of both sides of the coin - a future closer to where we're at now and from a perspective of value, work and personal fulfillment.

## How AI affects employees

With AI coming in with new ways of automating segments of the job market that wasn't possible previously to its uprising, there's no doubt that there will be a transfer of positions and power throughout every possible career field out there.

This means that you might be out of a job. You might have a change of title. You might have to take on larger workloads due to the new efficiency levels that are obtained. You might have new tools to help you branch further _into_ your field. It might simply make your job five times easier. It might make you enjoy and take on different aspects of you line of duty. Ultimately _there will be change in one way or another_. This is undoubtedly what you need to expect and prepare for whether you're on the lowest level of the corporate ladder or you're the big-wig CEO of a highly revered company.

## How AI changes companies

Companies who accept and integrate AI into their systems will ultimately be ahead of the competition in whichever industry they're in.

Those who revolt at the sight of AI will struggle to compete until forced to change. Competition with the backing of AI will be able to have better cost structures - allowing their pricing to be lower than any rival companies.

This also means that teams will be able to do more with less.

## AI's effects on your home life

With the creation of more efficient processes there will be a greater quality of life aspect to a lot of different areas. This is also very dependent on where you live and how you look at things.

There are a couple areas that could monetarily become better as time goes on:

- Price drops
- Larger salaries
- Universal Basic Income
- New free services

You would also expect services to become quicker and more automated whether it's a restaurant or a software service.

Another thing that you could look forward to is that in certain fields, startups would become infinitely easier to, well, start. The newly created tools would help you get your ideas out into the world in a painless, quick fashion.

## The current status of work and human collaboration

There's lots of different forms of work around the world. From construction to your typical office jobs, there's different forms of hierarchies that are laid out throughout all of them and these hierarchies exist due to one thing - human collaboration.

Without human collaboration we wouldn't have any structures in place. There wouldn't be groups of people dedicated to solving the world's issues, figuring out how to make more money, tackling bosses in Destiny, handling relationships of love. Everyone would be in solitude and, frankly, lonely.

So, human collaboration seems pretty important, doesn't it? It helps us craft things that we wouldn't have been able to individually. It can cut down tasks that would take years into months, weeks, days.

It is also extremely important for being able to really make a business out of anything as there's a collaboration aspect that comes from gathering feedback from clients and customers.

## Life's movement towards human collaboration

To review and summarize what we've just gone through:

- AI brings efficiency and changes to the work that you produce, automating what can be automated to allow you to focus on the more important aspects of the job
- AI brings efficiency and change to companies in ways that allow for different team structures, new competition and the let go of companies not willing to hop into the loop
- AI brings general quality of life raises, creating options for more free services, UBI, cheaper prices and larger salaries

With everything in place there's going to be a general drift into the space of making collaboration as enjoyable and fullfiling as possible whether it be for business, solving world issues or jumping into your next game session.

The interaction of people is what really makes life worth what it is. Without it there's no magic, there's no reason - life becomes a desolate place of suffering. That's why there's already hundreds of thousands of books focused on being able to communicate, make friends and even on how to control people.

This is the one thing you currently can't replace and it won't be replaced for a long time to come. It's also extremely valuable in today's world and becomes more valuable as each day goes by.
